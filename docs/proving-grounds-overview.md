In January 2025, we redesigned Proving Grounds with a new set of visuals, animations, and templates. This new direction retains the core style of the PG brand, while adapting a modern tech aesthetic with layers of grunge, 3D glass, and a preference for featuring posed game characters.

The modular nature of this package means any and all social graphics and broadcast screens can be used in conjunction with a new set of animated background loops, featuring a tiled PG logo over a CRT-inspired digital texture.
