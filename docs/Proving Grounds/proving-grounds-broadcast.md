## Intermission Screen

An intermission screen is a static or animated graphic displayed during broadcasts to signal breaks or transitions. Common examples include messages like "Starting Soon," "Be Right Back," or "Ending Stream." These screens help maintain viewer engagement during downtime by providing updates or setting expectations while the main content is paused or transitioning.

For BoomTV events, a single intermission screen is designed for all broadcast messages, with a blank space designed for the broadcast lead to incorporate the appropriate message for viewers, as well as a designated location for a live countdown if desired. For intermission screens and other screens where text is altered during a broadcast, it's important to coordinate with the BoomTV creative team and/or refer to this style guide for specifics on the appropriate typeface and sizing to use.

#### Technical Specifications

BoomTV intermission screens are typically a combination of a background loop and a static graphic, intended to be layered in the broadcast software. See the documentation on each specific broadcast package for details on how to use the intermission assets to create an appropriately styled broadcast screen for the event.

## Stinger

Stingers are transitional video elements designed to create a seamless bridge between scenes during live broadcasts or video editing. Unlike most video assets, which are commonly delivered as .mp4 files, stingers require a format that supports transparency, or the alpha channel. The alpha channel specifies which parts of the video should be transparent, allowing for smooth scene transitions. To capture this transparency, stingers are rendered as .mov files, which are larger than .mp4 files due to the additional data they contain.

It’s important to note that .mov files, including stingers, are not optimized for direct upload to social media. Their primary use is in live broadcast environments or within video editing software, where they serve as transition elements between clips.

#### Technical Specifications

A standard BoomTV stinger is 2 seconds long with a frame rate of 29.97 fps. However, shorter 1-second stingers are sometimes used, and more complex stingers may extend beyond 2 seconds. Regardless of the duration, the key feature of any stinger is the transitional point exactly halfway through the animation. This the moment when the animation fully covers the screen, allowing for a clean scene cut.

For example: A 2-second stinger at 29.97fps will have its transitional point at 1 second (30 frames out of 60). At this point, the animation should completely obscure the underlying scene, making it safe to switch to the next scene while the animation completes.

When delivering broadcast assets, documentation of the stinger’s length and frame rate are provided for the broadcast lead to ensure proper integration into the production workflow.
