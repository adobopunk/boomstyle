In January 2025, we redesigned Proving Grounds with a fresh set of visuals, animations, and templates. This new direction preserves the core identity of the PG brand while incorporating a modern tech aesthetic. The updated design features layered grunge textures alongside 3D glass elements. It is optimized to showcase posed 3D game characters.

## Motion System

The modular design of this package enables seamless integration of social graphics and broadcast screens with a new set of animated background loops, featuring the PG logo tiled over a digital texture of signal interference. A key aspect of this PG brand package is its emphasis on animated assets over static ones.

## Animated Background loop

The background loop for Proving Grounds assets is **PG_2025_Background_HD.**

Two alternate loops exist for convenience, intended only to be used if elements of the primary background loop clash with the asset. However, the main loop containing all elements of the style should be used whenever possible.

**Still to add: Square Loop**

## Social Assets

Social assets should be posted as animated videos whenever possible, to maximize visibility.

Announcement posts should be presented as square videos using the square PG animate background.

All other social posts using PG assets should be presented in 1920 x 1080 and use the **PG_2025_Background_HD** loop.
