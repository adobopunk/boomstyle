In January 2025, we redesigned Proving Grounds with a fresh set of visuals, animations, and templates. This new direction preserves the core identity of the PG brand while incorporating a modern tech aesthetic. The updated design features layered grunge textures alongside 3D glass elements. It is optimized to showcase posed 3D game characters.

## Motion System

The modular design of this package enables seamless integration of social graphics and broadcast screens with a new set of animated background loops, featuring the PG logo tiled over a digital texture of signal interference. A key aspect of this PG brand package is its emphasis on animated assets over static ones.
