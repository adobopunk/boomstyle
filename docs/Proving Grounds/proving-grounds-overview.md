In January 2025, we redesigned Proving Grounds with a new set of visuals, animations, and templates. This new direction retains the core style of the PG brand, while adapting a modern tech aesthetic with layers of grunge, 3D glass, and have been designed with featuring posed 3D game characters in mind.

## Motion System

The modular design of this package allows for the seamless integration of social graphics and broadcast screens with a new set of animated background loops. These loops feature the PG logo tiled over a CRT-inspired digital texture. Being able to integrate these animations whenever possible is a key feature of this PG brand package, which prefers animated assets over static.

<blockquote>While we've optimized the process to make integrating the motion loop as smooth as possible, it still adds time to the production cycle. To ensure a smooth workflow, it's important to clearly specify which social assets should include animation when making requests. Please provide as much lead time as possible when submitting requests for animated assets to ensure timely delivery.</blockquote>
