When incorporating the Proving Grounds logo into your third-party event, we have some basic style guidelines for you to follow, ensuring the logo appears professional, clean, and unmodified across all assets.

## Spacing

Use the "O" in the Proving Grounds logo as a guide for the minimum amount of space that should be present on all four sides of the Proving Grounds logo. Do not let other logos or graphic elements enter the minimum space.

## Partner Lockup

When designing a partner lockup that uses a "Your Brand x Proving Grounds" graphic, ensure both logos are of equal size, and use the spacing guidelines to ensure the x or other graphic elements do not intrude on the minimum space required around the logo.

## Backgrounds and Colors

Do not use background colors that make the PG logo excessively challenging to read.

Do not use official Proving Grounds backgrounds for third-party events.

## Modifications

Do not modify or create new versions of the Proving Grounds logo. This includes editing colors, changing proportions of individual parts of the logo, or changing the way the text is aligned.

## Green Light

Following the above style guide, use of the Proving Grounds logo should be no problem for most third-party events.

It's recommended to let the BoomTV team review your third party Proving Grounds assets before publishing them. Connect with Mateo [@matooty], graphic designer, or TJ [@adobo], animation director, via Discord with your assets, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
