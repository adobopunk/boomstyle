## .jpg

A compressed and widely compatible still image format, valued for its small file sizes and minimal loss of quality. It is commonly used on the web for efficient storage and fast loading.

## .mp4

A widely-used video file format optimized for web and digital distribution. Due to its universal compatibility and efficient performance, .mp4 is the standard format for web videos. BoomTV assets are generally rendered as .mp4s.

## .mov

A video file format supporting higher-quality video with additional features like transparency (alpha channel). Itâ€™s commonly used in professional editing and broadcast workflows but results in larger file sizes. The only BoomTV assets rendered as .movs are transitional elements like bumpers and stingers, which require alpha channel support.

## .png

An advanced still image format that can preserve transparency in an image. Broadcast assets are exported as .png files, so they can be easily placed over a background asset.

## Aspect Ratio

The proportional relationship between the width and height of a video or image. Common aspect ratios include 16:9 (widescreen) and 4:3 (standard for older televisions). Most BoomTV assets are designed in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is the standard for modern broadcasts.

## fps

Short for Frames Per Second, referring to Frame Rate.

## Frame Rate

Frame rate refers to the number of frames (individual images) displayed per second (fps) in a video asset. For most video assets, we use the standard broadcast frame rate of 29.97 fps (frames per second) or 30 fps. This frame rate is the standard for smooth playback in digital video.

<blockquote>
  For simplicity, this guide treats 29.97 fps and 30 fps as equivalent, as the difference was due to technical limitations of the past and is irrelevant in the modern era. <a href="https://www.diyphotography.net/camera-shoots-29-97fps-not-30fps-doesnt-really-matter/" target="_blank">(Why?)</a>
</blockquote>

An exception to this standard is animated video announcements, which are often rendered at 24 fps. This lower frame rate aligns with the traditional "cinematic" frame rate used in films, providing a stylistic aesthetic that mimics the feel of motion pictures.

## HD

A video resolution standard that provides higher clarity and detail compared to standard definition (SD). Common HD resolutions include 1280x720 (720p) and 1920x1080 (1080p), with 1080p often referred to as "Full HD." HD is widely used in broadcasts, online videos, and digital media for its sharp image quality, ease of use, and suitability for modern screens.

<blockquote>BoomTV files labeled with "_HD" at the end of the file name indicate this video is 1080p.</blockquote>

## Margin

The amount of space between an element and the other elements around it.

## Padding

The amount of space between an element and the edges of the container it resides in.

## Scene

A layout in broadcast software (e.g., OBS, vMix) that contains multiple assets like video, graphics, and animations. Scenes are used to transition between different parts of the broadcast, such as gameplay, interviews, and intermission screens.
