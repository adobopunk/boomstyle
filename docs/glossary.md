## .mp4

A widely-used video file format optimized for web and digital distribution. Due to its universal compatibility and efficient performance, .mp4 is the standard format for web videos. BoomTV assets are generally rendered as .mp4s.

## .mov

A video file format supporting higher-quality video with additional features like transparency (alpha channel). Itâ€™s commonly used in professional editing and broadcast workflows but results in larger file sizes. The only BoomTV assets rendered as .movs are transitional elements like bumpers and stingers, which require alpha channel support.

## fps

Short for Frames Per Second, referring to Frame Rate.

## Frame Rate

Frame rate refers to the number of frames (individual images) displayed per second in a video asset. For most video assets, we use a frame rate of 29.97 fps (frames per second) or 30 fps, meaning each second consists of approximately 30 individual images. This frame rate is the standard for smooth playback in digital video. For simplicity, this guide treats 29.97 fps and 30 fps as equivalent.

An exception to this standard is animated video announcements, which are occasionally rendered at 24 fps. This lower frame rate aligns with the traditional "cinematic" frame rate used in films, providing a stylistic aesthetic that mimics the feel of motion pictures.

## HD

A video resolution standard that provides higher clarity and detail compared to standard definition (SD). Common HD resolutions include 1280x720 (720p) and 1920x1080 (1080p), with 1080p often referred to as "Full HD." HD is widely used in broadcasts, online videos, and digital media for its sharp image quality, ease of use, and suitability for modern screens.

<blockquote>In general, BoomTV files labeled with "_HD" at the end of the file name indicate this video is 1080p.</blockquote>
