## Announcement Trailer

Announcement trailers are unique, animated and edited video assets, designed to promote upcoming events across social media channels. Each trailer is custom-made for each event, meaning there’s no standardized production pipeline. Instead, the scope, style, and length are tailored to the specific event, with an intention to always deliver the highest possible quality video. The only limitations are deadlines and the overall workload of the creative team.

When requesting announcement trailers, please provide as much detail as possible about the event and any specific client requests, including mandatory information to be included in the video. Details for an announcement trailer request may include:

-    Desired video aspect ratio (if applicable)
-    Event date and time
-    Call-to-action (CTA) details, such as website links or stream locations
-    Prize pool, if you’d like it featured in the trailer
