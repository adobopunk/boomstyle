## Announcement Graphic

Announcement graphics are static or animated assets created to announce and promote upcoming events on social media. They are typically the first asset posted in an event’s marketing schedule, unless an announcement trailer is produced, in which case a separate graphic is unnecessary.

As of 2025, BoomTV's announcement graphics prefer animated square 1:1 designs to maximize visibility and impact on social media timelines. This can be accomplished by layering a background loop with an announcement graphic and rendering as an .mp4 without audio.

For announcement graphics designed to be static images, a 4:5 vertical aspect ratio is preferred for social timelines. A 1:1 square image is also fine.

## Announcement Trailer

Announcement trailers are animated and edited video assets created to announce and promote upcoming events on social media. As the first asset in an event’s marketing schedule, they set the tone for the campaign.

Each trailer is uniquely crafted for its event, with the animation’s scope, style, copy, and duration tailored to factors such as client requirements, production timelines, and the creative team’s workload.

#### Technical Specifications

Announcement trailers are typically created as 1080p full HD videos, rendered at 24 or 29.97 fps.
