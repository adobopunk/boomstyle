Welcome to the BoomTV Style Guide, your go-to resource for properly utilizing assets created by the creative team, which is Mateo and TJ. We’ll keep this guide as accurate and up-to-date as possible to ensure seamless production workflows.

This guide serves as a centralized reference for BoomTV team members and external contractors, such as broadcast leads and operators. Here, you’ll find detailed instructions on how to use assets in each package to assemble cohesive, on-brand scenes for broadcasts.

Additionally, the guide outlines use of various graphics and animated assets for social media, as they typically crossover widely with broadcast assets and are used for both purposes.

<blockquote>Assets on this documentation site are compressed for web use and may not meet the quality requirements for production. Always download assets from the specified location in S3, as indicated at the top of each page, to ensure the highest quality.</blockquote>
