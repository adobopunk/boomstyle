The BoomTV Style Guide is a design overview built by BoomTV to provide guidance for using assets built by BoomTV's creative team. This guide serves as a centralized reference for both BoomTV members and external contractors using BoomTV's branding and associated branding.

Following these guidelines will help maintain the integrity of BoomTV and associated brands, and ensure that assets created by BoomTV team members are not being misused in ways that devalue the brand or the quality of the designs.

This guide is maintained by BoomTV's creative team, comprised of Mateo as Creative Director and TJ as Animation Director.
